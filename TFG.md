## how to pass auto-merge action
- Create a PR with `tfg` tag
- change only this Readme.md and add just one line at the end
- that line should look that ` | [title] | [link repo] | [comments] | `
- comments should be  between 7 and 100 chars length
- repo link should be a valid github repo
- take this PR as [example](https://github.com/addUsername/gh-actions/pull/3) `UPDATE THIS`
- bugs may occur

| Title | Repo | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| victor_robles_bot | https://github.com/addUsername/victor_robles_bot | test on fork, we should delete this |
